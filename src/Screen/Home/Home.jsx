              Bassically we are using the CNN model and advanced pre-trained
              models like YOLO v8 that offers a powerful tool for accurately
              diagnosing medical conditions from images.The training of your CNN
              model starts with a diverse and accurately labeled dataset. To
              improve generalization and prevent overfitting, data augmentation
              techniques like rotation, scaling, and color adjustments are used.

              The data is typically split into 70% training, 15% validation, and
              15% test sets, with model weights adjusted iteratively based on
              performance. For classification tasks, a categorical cross-entropy
              loss function is commonly employed to measure accuracy.
